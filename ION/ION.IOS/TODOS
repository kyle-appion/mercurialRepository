Big Ps

1) ptchart and superheat and subcool WORKING AS DESIGNED!!
  * altitude works
  * dew/bubble works
  * entries should show unit along with measurement?

**BUGS OR OUTSTANDING ISSUES**

ptchart and superheat
  * entries should show unit along with measurement?

subviews
  * AlternateUnit subview (pending units bug fix) [incorrect unit conversion]

PTChart SHSC show connected

Disconnect device crashes

connecting sometimes crashes app (non responsive)

ptchart / superheatsubcool when a manifold is in the viewcontroller will still
allow the user to add a new sensor (BUG!)


IOS Glitches
  * battery icon seems to work spottily (1 & 3 not have it, 2 & 4 do)



IOS
Acquiring location takes too long on start up, move location acquiring to thread
  so that it doesn't lock up start up


Ensure that fluid manager always has a last used fluid

ios location manager takes too long and stalls boot up. Also crashes occasionally
