TODOS

CORE
  UnitLookup
    * Using Unitlookup to find the code of a pressure kPa returns the vacuum kPa
      unit code. This is easily replicated by Adding a manual sensor to the
      analyzer, setting its unit to kPa and adding and alarm to it.

IOS
  Device Manager
    * Fix the connection spinner.
    * Let the user cancel a connection attempt (related to the spinner)
    * Fix the issue that connecting to a device marks all other devices (known
      or not) as disconnected

ANDROID
  Alarm
    * Manual sensors should not be allowed to have alarms

  Application APK / Runtime
    * Clearing the cache destroys the application (ie. the application will not
      start). This appears to be because the cache contained important non-apk
      dlls that are necessary for the c# runtime.

  Screenshot Activity
    * Allow screenshot to expand

  Analyzer Fragment
    - Sensor Mount
      * Fix swap animation
        ** Works for requested swap (dialog yes), but not normal swap

    - Manifold
      * Show "Linked sensor as secondary" toast when a secondary sensor is added
      * swapping a manifold with subviews to other empty doesn't ask to break subviews
      * adding a secondary sensor from across section boundary request swap when doesn't need to and replaces primary sensor

  Calibration Certificate Activity
    * add empty list TextView

  Workbench
    * Changing fluids isn't reflected in subview when back or arrow is clicked. Ok done works for superheat and subcool

  Report Manager
    * XML and PDF reports are not exported correctly

DEVICE SPECIFIC (Samsung Tablet 7 (found in the warehouse))
  Workbench
  	* The manifolds sometimes don't update when a device is connected / reconnected.
  		(could not reproduce)

  * Out of memory when reconnect goes into a weird loop



CURRENT BUILD ISSUES (0.9.37) ::

  Workbench
    * If all subviews are added to a manifold, when add subview is clicked, display a full toast.

    System Analyzer
      * Layout not saved on change
      * Adding a gauge to opposite empty manifold does not bring sensor properties with the manifold
      * Clearing current secondary for pressure gauge in shsc doesnt cause an error or warning when side is full
      * Adding a shsc sensor property to a manifold that already has a secondary sensor does not setup the sensor property correctly
      * Not checking for a breaking swap
      * adding a manual to a full side manifold crashes
      * adding a sensor from device manager to a full side doesn't populate the manifold

    Device Manager
      * A forgotten device still appears in the device manager as new
      * Connect all does not work at all on nexus 7
      * Connected to vacuum gauge after disconnect and got a

  Select Export Data
    * The drag handles for the graph selection are a little off from what the data says. To repeat this,
    simply drag the selection to a break in the graph. The speculated reason is that the adapter lookup
    is not considering the "empty" records that are used for padding.
