CORE
  UnitLookup
    * Using Unitlookup to find the code of a pressure kPa returns the vacuum kPa
      unit code. This is easily replicated by Adding a manual sensor to the
      analyzer, setting its unit to kPa and adding and alarm to it.

IOS
  Device Manager
    * Fix the connection spinner.
    * Let the user cancel a connection attempt (related to the spinner)
    * Fix the issue that connecting to a device marks all other devices (known
      or not) as disconnected



ANDROID
  Application APK / Runtime
    * Clearing the cache destroys the application (ie. the application will not
      start). This appears to be because the cache contained important non-apk
      dlls that are necessary for the c# runtime.

  Screenshot Activity
    * Allow screenshot to expand

  Analyzer Fragment
    - Sensor Mount
      * Fix swap animation
        ** Works for requested swap (dialog yes), but not normal swap

    - Manifold
      * Show "Linked sensor as secondary" toast when a secondary sensor is added
      * add secondary (linked) sensor subview
      * swapping a manifold with subviews to other empty doesn't ask to break subviews
      * adding a secondary sensor from across section boundary request swap when doesn't need to and replaces primary sensor

  Calibration Certificate Activity
    * add empty list TextView
