TODOS

IOS
  Device Manager
    * Fix the connection spinner.
    * Let the user cancel a connection attempt (related to the spinner)
    * Fix the issue that newly found devices refresh the list and reorganize it
    * Fix the issue that connecting to a device marks all other devices (known
      or not) as disconnected
      


ANDROID
  Application APK / Runtime
    * Clearing the cache destroys the application (ie. the application will not
      start). This appears to be because the cache contained important non-apk
      dlls that are necessary for the c# runtime.

  DeviceManager
    * Weird glitch were items (clicked at the right time) will swap order.
      (ie. Connect a device, and expand it as it connects will result in the
      devices sensors above the device).

  Workbench Fragment
     * workbench doesn't update contents when fragment changes

    - Manifold
      * manifold needs subview bar with linked label
      * manifold needs link divider from header and content
      * manifold and subviews need to be removable
      * add secondary (linked) sensor subview

  Screenshot Activity
    * Allow screenshot to expand

  Analyzer Fragment
    - Sensor Mount
      * Fix swap animation
        ** Works for requested swap (dialog yes), but not normal swap

    - Manifold
      * Show "Linked sensor as secondary" toast when a secondary sensor is added
      * add secondary (linked) sensor subview
      * swapping a manifold with subviews to other empty doesn't ask to break subviews
      * adding a secondary sensor from across section boundary request swap when doesn't need to and replaces primary sensor

  Calibration Certificate Activity
    * add empty list TextView
