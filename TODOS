Big Ps

1) ptchart and superheat and subcool WORKING AS DESIGNED!!
  * altitude works
  * dew/bubble works
  * entries should show unit along with measurement?
  * Null pointer when initing ptchart from workbench

//  3) Screenshot reporting (export as png)

4) device manager
  * swipe device left to forget

5) help menu (about, send feedback)



**BUGS OR OUTSTANDING ISSUES**

ptchart and superheat
  * entries should show unit along with measurement?

subviews
  * AlternateUnit subview (pending units bug fix) [incorrect unit conversion]

DeviceManager
